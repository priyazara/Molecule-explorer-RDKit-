Molecule-explorer-RDKit-
This is a small project where i worked with molecules like morphine, abacavir, and glucose using rdkit. i tried to understand how to create molecules, add hydrogens, draw them, and get basic info like atom count and rings.


# Molecules Used

Morphine – created from SMILES

Abacavir – downloaded from PubChem (SDF format)

Glucose – used to calculate molecular weight


# Purpose

i just wanted to get comfortable with using rdkit for basic molecule work. this will help in cheminformatics or drug discovery work later.

# Conclusion

i learned how to use rdkit to make, visualize, and analyze molecules. good practice for future projects in chemistry and ai.
